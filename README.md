# MeetUp

Meetup is an event management app.

## Milestone #01 (Proposal)

Initiated proposal for this project. This can be located inside the `docs` folder.

To visit this proposal documentation, run `npm run milestone-01`.

## Milestone #02 (Front-End)

To run and view this project's progress, execute `npm run milestone-02`.

In this milestone, the files can be located in the `client` folder.

## Milestone #03 (Back-End)

With the addition of the backend, we use `concurrently` dependency.
Frontend runs on `3000` port, while backend runs on `3001` port.

Because of this changes, do `npm install` or `npm i` beforehand.

To run and view this project's progress, execute `npm run start`. This `start` script should both execute `npm run milestone-02` and `npm run milestone-03`.
