                <p>
                    How often have you tried to make plans with your friends only to spend hours planning where you want
                    to go and when?
                    Matching up schedules and planning around your job, appointments, or other events in you and your
                    friends’ lives can
                    be difficult and time consuming. With MeetUp you can seamlessly import your calendars and it will
                    match it up with your
                    friends and family to help you decide on a time. You can also create new events straight from the
                    app and send them to
                    whoever you want to invite. They will receive a notification and be given the option to either
                    confirm or deny the request.
                    MeetUp takes the hard work out of planning events and helps you get straight to the fun part.

                    <p>
                        MeetUp, being a cutting-edge event planning app, will require robust API connections and a structured database. For API functionality, the application will use APIs from leading calendar apps, such as Google Calendar and Apple Calendar (iCal), enabling users to input and view their existing calendar data directly on our platform. On the database side, we will have two databases: a user database and an events database. The user database will store each user's information, including data synchronized from APIs, while the events database will store events. The persistent storage of this data will allow users to conveniently utilize our app for efficient and easy event planning.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the calendar APIs, we will integrate the three most used calendar APIs: Google Calendar, Outlook, and Apple Calendar. This will allow for convenience of use among both Android and Apple users. Once the calendars are imported, our application will ensure the data is continuously synchronized and that changes are reflected in both directions. In other words, if a user adds an event in our application, that change should be reflected in the user’s calendar app they use, and vice versa. We will likely use OAuth 2.0 for authentication and authorization to these APIs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition to calendar APIs, we will also integrate Google’s rich JavaScript APIs for location and maps. These will include Google Maps API, Places API, Directions API, and Distance Matrix API. The Places API will be used to search for places in the Google Maps database and retrieve information about a specific place. The Directions API will provide directions between multiple locations, supporting various travel modes such as driving, public transportation, and walking. The Distance Matrix API will calculate the distance and time between origins and destinations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The user database will include a user’s basic account information. In addition, a user will have three lists: a friends list, an events list, and an API calendar list. The friends list is a running list of friends the user has. The events list will be a list of events that the user is invited to or has created. For each event, the database will store whether a user has RSVP’d and whether they are the creator of the event or an invitee. The API list is a list of the user’s imported calendars represented as objects.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The events database will be a list of event objects, each containing two components: one is the event information, such as the description, start time, end time, etc. The second is the list of participants, represented with the userID and a boolean for whether they are going or not.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In short, the backend is responsible for handling database retrieval and modifications such as user creation, event creation, and joining events. It is also responsible for connecting with the calendar and map APIs to allow for the primary functionality of the application. In addition to these, there will also be algorithmic functions that handle the problem of finding the best times/locations for events based on the users invited or going to the event.

                <p>
                    In today's bustling world, many applications serve as vital conduits connecting individuals to
                    meaningful events, yet often need to improve in creating truly engaging experiences. This gap has
                    inspired the development of MeetUp, an app designed to transcend these limitations through a
                    community-driven and user-centric approach. Unlike traditional platforms that offer a generalized
                    event discovery experience, MeetUp prioritizes personalization and community engagement, enabling
                    users to connect with events that align with their personal interests, values, and schedules.
                </p>
                <p>
                    MeetUp distinguishes itself by leveraging the power of community feedback and social networking
                    features. It allows users to discover events through recommendations based on their network's
                    activities and preferences. This model simplifies the discovery process and fosters a vibrant
                    community atmosphere, making users feel like active participants rather than mere attendees.
                    Enhanced by
                    user-generated content, attendees can share experiences, reviews, and photos, turning each event
                    into a
                    collaborative and enriching community experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This approach redefines event management by focusing on human connections and shared interests,
                    making MeetUp not just an app but a movement towards more meaningful and personalized event
                    engagement. By
                    prioritizing in favor of a more accessible and community-focused strategy, MeetUp stands as a start
                    for a realistic innovation in event discovery and participation, ensuring that every user can find
                    and
                    contribute to events that resonate deeply with their personal and communal identities.

            <h2>Integrative Experience</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>
                    The development of MeetUp is deeply rooted in an integrative educational journey, not just from a
                    single perspective but through the collective effort of a diverse team of students. Each member
                    brings a unique combination of academic backgrounds and personal experiences. Rather than viewing
                    the undergraduate experience as fragmented—filled with a variety of general education requirements,
                    major-specific courses, and extracurricular activities—our team has seen it as a rich foundation
                    from which to build something truly innovative. Inspired by our varied backgrounds and experiences,
                    our journey in creating MeetUp is a testament to our collective effort to overcome educational
                    fragmentation, adopting an integrated approach that equips us for a lifetime of learning and
                    problem-solving.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a team, we have navigated the challenge of integrative thinking, drawing upon our varied
                    disciplines—from computer science, social science, history, and literature to business management.
                    Our computer science coursework provided us with the technical skills to build MeetUp. At the same
                    time, social science
                    offered insights into human behavior and the essence of community, crucial for creating a platform
                    that fosters meaningful connections. History courses enriched our understanding of societal
                    evolution and the significance of communal gatherings, reminding us that events have always served
                    as pivotal moments in shaping, not just within cultures and societies, but also extending to our
                    interbeing. Literature, with its exploration of human experience and emotion, inspired us to
                    craft a platform that resonates on a deeply personal level,
                    facilitating storytelling and shared experiences among users. Business courses equipped us with the
                    knowledge to position and
                    grow MeetUp strategically in a competitive market. Beyond the classroom, our extracurricular
                    activities and personal life experiences enriched our understanding of event participants' diverse
                    needs and challenges, further motivating us to develop a user-centric and community-focused
                    solution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Embodying the criteria of the Integrative Experience, our project has been a structured, credited
                    endeavor that allowed us to reflect on and integrate our learning from general education and
                    major-focused studies. We practiced and honed skills such as collaboration, critical thinking, and
                    interdisciplinary perspective-taking, applying our cumulative knowledge to the complex problem of
                    improving event management through technology. MeetUp represents our shared learning experience,
                    using our prior education to tackle real-world challenges, embodying the spirit of integrative
                    thinking and collaborative problem-solving. This project is not just a culmination of our education
                    but a beginning to our contribution to the professional and civic world, showcasing how varied
                    educational components can coalesce into a coherent and impactful whole.
