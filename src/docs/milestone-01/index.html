                    How often have you tried to make plans with your friends only to spend hours planning where you want
                    to go and when?
                    Matching up schedules and planning around your job, appointments, or other events in you and your
                    friends’ lives can
                    be difficult and time consuming. With MeetUp you can seamlessly import your calendars and it will
                    match it up with your
                    friends and family to help you decide on a time. You can also create new events straight from the
                    app and send them to
                    whoever you want to invite. They will receive a notification and be given the option to either
                    confirm or deny the request.
                    MeetUp takes the hard work out of planning events and helps you get straight to the fun part.

                    The first wireframe for our  Meet Up application is shown above. It includes the main page landing page that users are shown when they come to our page, a search bar and filter options are opened so then they can create their very first event that they want to host. They can create a name, location, people they want to invite and the date of the event. They can then press create event which will take them to the next wireframe.

                <p>
                    The next wireframe is of the login page of our web application. Users can get directed to this page by either pressing the log in button at the top of the launch page or by pressing the create event on the launch page. The user can log in by their user name and password. Or if they are a new user they can press sign up  at the bottom of the page.

                    The last wireframe is of the actual Meet Up application, the application has been meticulously designed to provide a clear and intuitive user experience, focusing on ease of navigation and accessibility. The Home Page wireframe sets the stage with a welcoming layout that highlights the application's primary features, including a prominent search function to use to look up what events are happening and what users are attending. This page is designed to immediately engage users, offering a snapshot of the most relevant information and recent community events that is occuring in their town or via their friends.

                <p>
                    In today's bustling world, many applications serve as vital conduits connecting individuals to
                    meaningful events, yet often need to improve in creating truly engaging experiences. This gap has
                    inspired the development of MeetUp, an app designed to transcend these limitations through a
                    community-driven and user-centric approach. Unlike traditional platforms that offer a generalized
                    event discovery experience, MeetUp prioritizes personalization and community engagement, enabling
                    users to connect with events that align with their personal interests, values, and schedules.
                </p>
                <p>
                    MeetUp distinguishes itself by leveraging the power of community feedback and social networking
                    features. It allows users to discover events through recommendations based on their network's
                    activities and preferences. This model simplifies the discovery process and fosters a vibrant
                    community atmosphere, making users feel like active participants rather than mere attendees.
                    Enhanced by
                    user-generated content, attendees can share experiences, reviews, and photos, turning each event
                    into a
                    collaborative and enriching community experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This approach redefines event management by focusing on human connections and shared interests,
                    making MeetUp not just an app but a movement towards more meaningful and personalized event
                    engagement. By
                    prioritizing in favor of a more accessible and community-focused strategy, MeetUp stands as a start
                    for a realistic innovation in event discovery and participation, ensuring that every user can find
                    and
                    contribute to events that resonate deeply with their personal and communal identities.

            <h2>Integrative Experience</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>
                    The development of MeetUp is deeply rooted in an integrative educational journey, not just from a
                    single perspective but through the collective effort of a diverse team of students. Each member
                    brings a unique combination of academic backgrounds and personal experiences. Rather than viewing
                    the undergraduate experience as fragmented—filled with a variety of general education requirements,
                    major-specific courses, and extracurricular activities—our team has seen it as a rich foundation
                    from which to build something truly innovative. Inspired by our varied backgrounds and experiences,
                    our journey in creating MeetUp is a testament to our collective effort to overcome educational
                    fragmentation, adopting an integrated approach that equips us for a lifetime of learning and
                    problem-solving.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a team, we have navigated the challenge of integrative thinking, drawing upon our varied
                    disciplines—from computer science, social science, history, and literature to business management.
                    Our computer science coursework provided us with the technical skills to build MeetUp. At the same
                    time, social science
                    offered insights into human behavior and the essence of community, crucial for creating a platform
                    that fosters meaningful connections. History courses enriched our understanding of societal
                    evolution and the significance of communal gatherings, reminding us that events have always served
                    as pivotal moments in shaping, not just within cultures and societies, but also extending to our
                    interbeing. Literature, with its exploration of human experience and emotion, inspired us to
                    craft a platform that resonates on a deeply personal level,
                    facilitating storytelling and shared experiences among users. Business courses equipped us with the
                    knowledge to position and
                    grow MeetUp strategically in a competitive market. Beyond the classroom, our extracurricular
                    activities and personal life experiences enriched our understanding of event participants' diverse
                    needs and challenges, further motivating us to develop a user-centric and community-focused
                    solution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Embodying the criteria of the Integrative Experience, our project has been a structured, credited
                    endeavor that allowed us to reflect on and integrate our learning from general education and
                    major-focused studies. We practiced and honed skills such as collaboration, critical thinking, and
                    interdisciplinary perspective-taking, applying our cumulative knowledge to the complex problem of
                    improving event management through technology. MeetUp represents our shared learning experience,
                    using our prior education to tackle real-world challenges, embodying the spirit of integrative
                    thinking and collaborative problem-solving. This project is not just a culmination of our education
                    but a beginning to our contribution to the professional and civic world, showcasing how varied
                    educational components can coalesce into a coherent and impactful whole.
